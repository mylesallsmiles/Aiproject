# Facenet_Tensorflow
# Face Recognition Training Program

This program is used for training a face recognition classifier using preprocessed face images. It utilizes the FaceNet model for extracting face embeddings and trains a classifier to recognize individuals based on these embeddings.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure that you have the following:

- Preprocessed face images: Place the preprocessed face images in the `aligned_img` directory.
- FaceNet model: Download the FaceNet model checkpoint and place it in the `model` directory. The model checkpoint can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EXPBSXwTaqrSC0OhUdXNmKSh9qJUQ55-).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-training.git

To train the face recognition classifier, follow these steps:

Run the training program:


Copy code
python train_classifier.py
Wait for the training process to complete. The program will output the path to the saved classifier model file.

The trained classifier model will be saved to the specified class/classifier.pkl file.
